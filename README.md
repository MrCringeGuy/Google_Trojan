# Google_Trojan
A trojan virus disguised as an email from Google about a trail for the new Google + (better but paid version).
This email will show that you are a winner of a prize, it will come with the program and license key.
It will then grab account details (logging into Google services e.g: Google Mail +) and send them to the email address of the creator/distributor of this virus.

If you use this, be warned that it is illegal. Also remember to try to target old and quite young people, as they are more vunerable to internet scams.
