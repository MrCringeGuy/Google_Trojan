# The YouMail Trojan
A virus which targets elderly/very young users. Hidden as a more simple email service which lets you log in to your email account and 'send' emails to people. In reality, it will make my discord bot go online. When I notice it is online, I type !data and the email 'sends'. I get the email address and password.
